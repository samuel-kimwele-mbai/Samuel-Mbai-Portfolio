            <h3>Students Hub</h3>
            <p>Students Hub is a secure, Android-based application developed as my final-year project to assist university students in 
                collaborating on academic projects, sharing resources, and managing study groups efficiently. The app addresses common challenges 
                students face in organizing and managing their academic work, offering a structured platform for collaboration and communication.</p><br>

            <p>The application features secure user authentication through Firebase, ensuring only authorized users can access the platform. Students 
                can create and join project workspaces, assign tasks, and track progress in real time. It also includes a resource-sharing feature,
                allowing users to upload and access academic materials, facilitating easy exchange of information within study groups.</p>
                promote smooth communication, Students Hub integrates a real-time messaging system, enabling users to discuss ideas and share updates 
                within their project teams. The app also incorporates task management tools, helping students stay organized and meet deadlines 
                effectively.</p><br>

            <p>Built using Android Studio, Firebase, and MySQL, the app ensures a seamless, secure user experience while demonstrating my skills in 
                mobile app development and problem-solving. Through this project, I was able to create a solution to improve collaboration among students
                and address key challenges faced in academic settings.A secure platform that helps university students collaborate on academic 
                projects.</p><br>
